# Hello World!

This is my home page! My name is Andrew Valdivia and I am a student at [Cal State Fullerton](http://www.fullerton.edu/) and my major is Electrical Engineering.

### CPSC 120

* Lab 2

    For the second lab, I consider it to be one of my favorites as it is when my coding journey essentially started. 
    We were tasked with understanding and utilizing the basic fundamentals and building blocks of programming and 
    that can be seen primarily through the main concept of the lab that being [Strings.](en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string.html)
    The main task at hand was learning how to declare a string in C++ and utilizing that to creat our own minature version of
    the word game Mad Libs. What made this the most captivating for me was simply that this was something new I was learning 
    and once I saw my work pay off by the code actually running, I was pretty ecstatic to say the least.

* Lab 4

    For the fourth lab, I had some more experience and knowledge under my belt but it was still pretty early on in terms of 
    the actual content I was learning. What our objectives were this time around was being able to utilize and understand the 
    concept of unit functions and how you can write a piece of code that can help you with specific things like in this case,
    the measurements of volume. This was just for the first part and was the main part I worked on and I enjoyed it quite a bit 
    because of the fact that the way that I was writing and structuting my code made me feel like I was utilizing a digital 
    programmable version of lego blocks. One line of code would be the basis for the next and that line of code would be the 
    basis for that one too and it would all just keep repeating satisfyingly.

* Lab 8

    For the eighth lab, it was pretty challenging but a fun challenge nonetheless as it was similar to the 4th lab. It was similar
    in the sense that it was tasking us to understand and utilizie various different functions and pieces of code to create a program
    that when prompted, will give us the average of the numbers that the user inputs into the program. It's a very simple concept but 
    it was still very nice to tackle as it goes to show how simple on paper these things might be when in all reality, theres a lot 
    that is going on behind the scenes to perform these calculations. The first part was primarily my favorite as it was the main one 
    I got to work on and contribute the most to. I found it so interesting as to how we can attribute things like "score_sum" to 
    an actual value and have that connect and react with other values, functions and concepts.
